<h1><?php echo __('About Snippets') ?></h1>

<p>
Snippets is a code snippet sharing platform for developers.
Snippets is developed by the developers of Hoydaa Open Source 
Organization. Snippets is developed to provide a high quality
code snippet sharing platform with highlighting, tagging and 
searching support.
</p>

<p>
Snippets is using Hoydaa's open source code highlighting library, 
CodeSnippet. CodeSnippet is a project under development, every day
new extensions --support for new languages-- are being added. Snippets
will take advantage of this improvement by itself. Snippets will also 
support new languages day by day with no extra user effort. Code snippets
submitted, will be automatically highlighted when the appropriate 
support is added to CodeSnippet.
</p>

<p>
In the future we are also planning to integrate Snippets with existing blogging
applications in order to provide developers a single point blogging opportunity.
