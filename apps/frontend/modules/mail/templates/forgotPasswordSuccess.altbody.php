Dear askeet user,

A request for <?php echo $mail->getSubject() ?> was sent to this address.

For safety reasons, the askeet website does not store passwords in clear.
When you forget your password, askeet creates a new one that can be used in place.

You can now connect to your askeet profile with:

username: <?php echo $username ?>
password: <?php echo $password ?>

To get connected, go to the login page (http://www.askeet.com/login)
and enter these codes.

We hope to see you soon on askeet!
